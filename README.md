# tinyParsec
`tinyParsec` is a minimal parsing library (similar to [`Parsec`](https://github.com/haskell/parsec)) using parser combinators fully written in Haskell.

The repo contains a Jupyter Notebook with the source-code and a comprehensive, step-by-step explanation of the concepts and the code in the entire library, with a simple JSON parser in the end as an example.

TODO:
1- [ ] Change the names of combinators to follow `Parsec`'s
2- [ ] Upgrading it to a simple parser generator.
